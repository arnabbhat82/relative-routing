we will use relative path for going back one folder up 
But we will use location for search results for going back or forward

  { path: 'parent', component: ParentComponent },


import { Location } from '@angular/common';


  constructor(private router: Router, private location: Location) {}
    this.router.navigate(['child']);
    this.location.back();
    this.location.forward();


    this.router.navigate(['../parent'], { relativeTo: this.route });
